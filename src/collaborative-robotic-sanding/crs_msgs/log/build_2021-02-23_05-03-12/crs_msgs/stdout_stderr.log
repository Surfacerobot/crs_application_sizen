CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:34 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcartesian_trajectory_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "cartesian_trajectory_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "cartesian_trajectory_msgs" with any of the following names:

    cartesian_trajectory_msgsConfig.cmake
    cartesian_trajectory_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "cartesian_trajectory_msgs" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "cartesian_trajectory_msgs_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "cartesian_trajectory_msgs" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
